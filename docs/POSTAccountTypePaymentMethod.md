# ZuoraClient.Model.POSTAccountTypePaymentMethod
Container for information on payment methods to associate with this account. To associate a credit card payment method when creating an account, Zuora recommends that you use this field instead of the `creditCard` field.  Note that you can not use this field together with `creditCard` or `hpmCreditCardPaymentMethodId` to associate a payment method to an account.  When creating a credit card payment method, it is recommended to enable [the support for stored credential transactions](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/L_Payment_Methods/Stored_credential_transactions) for this payment method. Specify the [required fields](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/L_Payment_Methods/Stored_credential_transactions/Configuration_procedures/Create_a_new_payment_method) to enable the support.
